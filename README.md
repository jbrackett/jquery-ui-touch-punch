After adding in the trigger ideas from hconceicao's pull request from the mainline the last problem I was having is solved.  Thanks to him for finding that issue.

Android drag and drop seems to be working pretty well now.  The one caveat is that the second item you try to dnd has to be clicked once before it will drag.  I dont' have access to an IPad/IPhone at the moment so I'm not sure about those.
